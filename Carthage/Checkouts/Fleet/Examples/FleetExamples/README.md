Included in this folder is an example project totally test-driven using Fleet. As you learn 
Fleet, we encourage you to check out its tests for guidance and best practices. 

Fleet loves [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) and [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble),
and so this project includes tests written using those two frameworks in the [WithQuick](./FleetExamplesTests/WithQuick)
folder.

Because not all projects prefer the BDD-style testing that Quick facilitates, all tests written using Quick
have functionally-equivalent versions written using only XCTest in the [WithXCTest](./FleetExamplesTests/WithXCTest) 
folder.
